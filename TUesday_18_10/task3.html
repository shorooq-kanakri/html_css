<p>  This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.</p>
<ul>
    <h5>Jack would really like..</h5>
    <li>Roller blades </li>
    <li> Magic tricks</li>
    <li> Anything Pokémon </li>
    <li> A motorized Lego set</li>
</ul>
<p> You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular one are <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/">https://www.toysrus.com/</a> and <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/">eToys</a></p>
